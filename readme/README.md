## Website Structure and Design

### Design Choices

I sat down with the company directors and we discussed the company and their needs in depth. Given the nature of their work it was clear they needed a simple, clear informative and welcoming website without overwhelming users with too much information at any one time.

I used this infomation to utilise my knowlege of design coupled with the psycology of color to come up with the following color pallet:

- #d4f1f4
- #75e6da
- #189ab4
- #05445e

I also decided on the use of carousels and cards. Both of these elements allow
you to display a lot of information in an easy to read, focused and interactive format. This allows users to browse each element at leasure taking away the daunting task of reading block text and giving them time to digest any information they read.

the company opted not to link any of their social media to their website at this point whilst their pages are under revision.

### WireFrames

The propsed layouts were shown to the team at NFC before commencing with development.
they were happy with what was shown and so i commenced working on the project.

During development certain elements seemed busy or like they could be presented in a more accessable way. In these Scenarios revised Layouts were designed and sent over to the NFC team for approval.
